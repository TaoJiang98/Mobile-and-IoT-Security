<p class=MsoNormal><b>Study Title: </b>Blocking robocalls with automated
machine learning interpretation of content<span style='color:red'><br>
</span><b>Protocol #: </b>4809</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Please read this study information sheet carefully before
you decide to participate in the study.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Purpose of the research study:</b> The purpose of the
study is to detect robocalls using machine learning techniques in order to
efficiently detect spam and robocallers through brief voice interactions. The
knowledge gained from this study can be applied to a more robust detection
system that effectively thwarts a much greater number of these type of calls.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='line-height:115%'><b>Participant requirements:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='line-height:115%'>(1) Age 18 and older</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='line-height:115%'>(2) Literate in English</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='line-height:115%'>(3) Have Android smartphone
running Android version 7.0 (API 24) or later</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='line-height:115%'>(4) Have T-Mobile as carrier</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>What you will do in the study:</b> In this study, you
will need to perform three tasks to fulfill the minimum requirements. First,
you will need to answer a very brief survey to provide us with basic
demographic information. Second, you will need to download and set the Custom
Phone Dialer Android app as your default phone app. Third, you will need to
forward <i>at least </i>one unwanted phone call using the app. This action
will, upon the phone call ending (i.e. The phone finishes ringing), forward the
caller to our servers to interact with your unwanted caller. This interaction
is the data we seek to collect. To be clear, our server will <i>not</i> be
interacting with you; it will interact with the entity who called you. All you
will have to do is pass on this call. Upon completion of these three tasks, you
will notify us so we may distribute your compensation. Prolific participants
will message us using the prolific platform, and offline participants
(non-Prolific participants) will email us at <a name="_Hlk87933843">mrcrobocalltranscripts@gmail.com</a>.
You will be provided step-by-step on how to complete these tasks later in the
study. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='line-height:115%'>* Note 1: that you may skip any survey
question that makes you uncomfortable and that you may revoke consent at any
time during the study. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='line-height:115%'>* Note 2: If you email us at any
address, we will not retain this or any other personally identifiable information.
It will be used only for the purposes of compensation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='line-height:115%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Time required:</b> The study will require about 20
minutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Risks:</b> The only risk is that you may forward a caller
who asks for your name. Since we are saving transcripts to our database, that
would mean that your name would end up in the database too. To alleviate this
issue, we will preprocess the information manually and remove any personally
identifiable information from the phone transcripts. There are no other
anticipated risks in this study.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Benefits:</b> There are no direct benefits to you for
participating in this research study. However, the study may help us design a
more robust system that can quickly identify robocallers and spam callers in
real time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Confidentiality:</b> The information that you give in the
study will be anonymous. Your name and other information that could be used to
identify you will not be collected or linked to the data. If you are an
non-Prolific participant, your email address will not be stored anywhere and
will be used only to communicate with you for the duration of the study and for
payment purposes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Voluntary participation:</b> Your participation in the
study is completely voluntary. You may discontinue participation at any time
during the research activity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Right to withdraw from the study:</b> You have the right
to withdraw from the study at any time without penalty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>How to withdraw from the study:</b> If you want to
withdraw from the study, follow one of the following protocols depending on
what stage of the study you are in:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><i><u>If you have not yet completed the survey:</u> </i>Ignore the
rest of the survey and <i>do not</i> submit it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><i><u>If you have submitted the survey but have not yet
downloaded the app:</u> </i>Do not download the app. You may also choose to notify
us stating that you would like your survey data removed. Make sure you provide
your participant ID number in this message so we know which data to remove. However,
this is not required.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><i><u>If you have downloaded the app but have not yet forwarded
any calls:</u> </i>Delete the app, and then follow the same process as the
above bullet. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><i><u>If you have downloaded the app and have forwarded one or
more calls:</u></i> Follow the previous bullet’s protocol. However, please note
that the forwarded call information is not tagged with any identifying
information. Therefore, we will be unable to remove any of these data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is no penalty for withdrawing; however, you will only
receive compensation if you complete all three parts of the study – the survey,
downloading the app, and forwarding <i>at least</i> one call. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Payment:</b> You will be compensated $4 after you
complete each of the three tasks described above: completing the survey,
downloading the app, and forwarding at least one call. As an added incentive
for you to forward as many calls to us as possible, for each additional call you
forward, we will further compensate you with a 20-cent bonus, up to a maximum
of an additional $4. Therefore, all participants will be compensated between $4
and $8 depending on how many bonus calls were forwarded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Using data beyond this study: </b>The data you provide in
this study will be retained in a secure manner by the researcher for this study
and will not be used beyond this study.</p>
